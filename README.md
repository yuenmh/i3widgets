# i3widgets
Easy to use status bar elements for `i3blocks`

Right now it's very specialized to my usage, but I might make it more configurable in the future.

# Features
- âš¡ Blazingly fast (not that I've tested other projects)
- ðŸ¦€ Written in Rust (which I am legally required to mention 50 times per day)
